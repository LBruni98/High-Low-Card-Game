## Introduction
This design document showcases the design, development and implementation of "High Low", along with the features and mechanics within the game.

#### Brief Description
It's a simple high stakes game that has you quickly betting against the dealer! Is the card higher or lower than yours? Bet the amount that you want and the game will change the intensity in how much you place on the table!

The cards are randomized and will come with different values, its up to you to guess whether it'll be higher or lower! Sounds easy? *Looks* easy? Looks can be very deceiving...

> Do you feel lucky?

#### High-Level Description
A player is shown a random playing card, then is asked to decide whether the next card will be 'higher' or 'lower'. If the guess is correct, the player is awarded with a 'cash' prize.

Required language: C++

## Development

#### User Stories
1. As a user, I would like to be able to play the game
2. As a user, I would like to enter my name
3. As a user, I would like to have a card dealt
4. As a user, I would like to be able to guess either high or low
5. As a user, I would like to be able to bet a specific amount
6. As a user, I would like to win or lose with notification
7. As a user, I would like to to be able to leave the game when I want

#### Use of Teamwork/Communication
Not too different from the first project, the task asked for the planning to be carried out in groups and work is to be completed individually. Again, I helped with the user stories to help out with creating the project in the form of small tasks.

I also helped out fellow members of 'Reboot games' when it came to some aspects of their versions of the product. The betting portion of the game and dealing the cards.

#### Flowchart

Here the flowchart displays what the project should do, as well as what happens when the player is right or wrong with guessing the dealt cards. It shows the betting portion and if the player's money equates to zero, the game is over and the player can choose whether to start again or end the game.
