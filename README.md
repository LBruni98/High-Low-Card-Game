The High-Low Card Game

#### About the game
It's a simple high stakes game that has you quickly betting against the dealer! Is the card higher or lower than yours? Bet the amount that you want and the game will change the intensity in how much you place on the table!

The cards are randomized and will come with different values, its up to you to guess whether it'll be higher or lower! Sounds easy? *Looks* easy? Looks can be very deceiving...
